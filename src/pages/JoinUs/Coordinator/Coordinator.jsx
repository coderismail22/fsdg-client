            After the Rohingya refugee influx different factors led to unrest
            among refugee and host community. The project was designed to
            provide livelihood support to both the refugee and host community to
            create a balance in the socio-economic condition between the two
            communities. Since I was involved with implementation of numerous
            livelihoods projects of CNRS, I thought this would be great
            opportunity for me to stand by the affected people again but in a
            totally different context where each step welcomes new challenges
            and possibilities. One of the great aspects of this project in my
            eyes is that it works for women empowerment as 99% of the
            beneficiaries have been female. It’s my observation that women work
            the hardest but at the end they are denied of basic human rights.
            For an example, while talking about agriculture, we only talk about
            male farmers. But there is a big number of female farmers who work
            as hard as the male group. In this project we have tried to provide
            support to those women who have faced the rigid societal roles where
            they are asked to stay silent, who have faced the vicious cycle of
            poverty, who have been abandoned by their family but on the top of
            everything who have wanted to fight every disaster with the force of
            their own self-reliance. It has been five years since we are working
            with them and I have seen it all. I have seen how self-reliance can
            be the driving energy for people to achieve major changes. Now many
            of the women who have participated in the project activities have
            ensured a better financial condition. Some of them come to us and
            say “you have helped us to bring the changes.” Every time they say
            this every time I reply “it’s not us, but you who have achieved the
            changes.” Yes, it has been them from the beginning, we are just
            blessed enough to be a part of their journey towards prosperity and
            peace.
