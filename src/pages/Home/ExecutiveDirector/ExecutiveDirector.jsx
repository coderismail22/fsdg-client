            CNRS would not have been able to reach its goal without the effort
            of these change-makers. The CNRS family is also thankful to all the
            development partners for upholding their trust in CNRS. In this
            reporting year, we have implemented a total of 31 projects, which
            cut across all the thematic areas of CNRS. Our sense of urgency is
            always motivating us to avoid any kind of procrastination without
            being complacent. We are, indeed, content to inform our development
            partners and stakeholders that we have achieved most of our targets
            of the reporting year, which gives us utmost satisfaction. In the
            entirety of the reporting year, we face and overcame the outbreak of
            Covid-19 crisis, which had been the prime challenge of the year. By
            complying with the directives of the Bangladesh Government, CNRS
            prepared an operational modality during the Covid-19 pandemic and
            persisted with its organizational activities by following this
            operational modality. Staff members of CNRS donated one day&apos;s
            salary to support people who were struggling to cope with the
            pandemic. It is worth mentioning that under two Covid-19 response
            projects, CNRS provided emergency response support to people
            affected for Covid-19 pandemic. We also provided cash for work
            support to both Rohingya and host communities through WFP and UNHCR
            supported projects. I believe the key ingredients for our success,
            are the resolute guidance from our EC and general body, the
            continual support of development partners and the sincere
            participation of the project participants and their firm effort to
            thrive for success. I take this opportunity to thank you all.
