        <p className="text-[#687279]">
          Public – Private Partnership (PPP) is a relatively new experience for
          Bangladesh. The term “Public-Private Partnership” describes a plethora
          of possible relationships among public and private entities (private
          companies,NGOs, CBOs etc.) in the context of infrastructure and other
          projects and services. In a PPP, the public sector retains a
          significant role, either as the sole purchaser of the services or as
          the main enabler of the project. The private party commonly provides
          the detailed design, construction, operation, and financing for the
          PPP project, and is paid according to the performance. Through PPP,
          the skills, assets, and/or financial resources of each of the public
          and private sectors are allocated in a complementary manner, thereby
          sharing the risks and rewards to seek to provide optimal service
          delivery and good value to citizens. In PPP projects, the private
          sector is the active party who undertakes activities, depending on the
          model. A successful PPP is perceived as a mutually beneficial approach
          for both public and private partners. The private sector can apply
          their innovation, expertise, latest technology, creativeness,
          efficiency, experience and their quality of work in the development
          and implementation of key sectors for growth in the country. On the
          other hand, the government can provide support and assistance through
          legal environment conducive and PPP friendly and regulatory networks.
          Through such collaborative networks, the government can ensure more
          efficiency in service delivery to the citizens; achieve faster and
          sustainable economic growth; have access to private investment and
          schedule certainty; enjoy greater confidence from the local and
          foreign investors; have more skilled, fewer and better paid off
          staffs; and exchange manpower with the private sector for capacity
          building. Similarly, the private sectors can expand their business;
          enhance more productivity in an enabling environment; and can
          participate in the overall economic development process of the
          country. The concept of PPPs to implement projects is a radical
          transformation. It is a revolution in terms of decision making; risk
          sharing, formulation and implementation, strategic management,
          accountability, personnel management and so on. Quick service
          delivery, efficient execution of public projects, diversity in goods
          and services require the PPPs model. It is a networking approach in
          infrastructure and other services where the private sector and the
          general people along with the government work for the country’s
          development and progress. CNRS, under the PPP model, supplied
          materials, engaged in various activities at a time such as financing,
          designing, community mobilization, construction, ownership,
          maintenance, and management in different projects. CNRS used the
          latest and cost effective means and technologies in order to complete
          the project allocated which enabled the best source of value for money
          gain.

          applying PAPD in various project sites (MACH, SEMP, CBFM-2, etc) and
